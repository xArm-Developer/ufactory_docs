# xArm Series

The purpose of this article is to guide the user to distinguish the model of UFactory xArm by SN.

<div align="left">

{% hint style="success" %}
①: stands for the number of axes of the arm.
{% endhint %}

There are three values: S / I / F.

| S     | I     | F     |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| xArm7 | xArm6 | xArm5 |



{% hint style="success" %}
⑪：stands for the type of harmonic type.
{% endhint %}

If ⑪ is 0, please send the SN of the xArm to technical support(email:support@ufactory.cc)

If⑪ is A,  the robotic arm is model 4.

If ⑪ is L,  the robotic arm is **model 2**.

If ⑪ is B,  the robotic arm is model1/model3:

&#x20;  1\) If ⑥⑦ is 04-12 and the position ⑧⑨ is 20, the model of the UFACTORY xArm is **model 3** (such as 0420).

&#x20;  2\) If  ⑥⑦⑧⑨ is other numbers, the model of the UFACTORY Arm is **model 1.**



**For example:**

SN of the robotic arm:  XF 1304 12C2 3B1E

It is xArm5,  model 1.



SN of the robotic arm: XI130506D43A0A

It is xArm6, model 4.
