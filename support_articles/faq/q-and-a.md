A: NO, all caches on the control box will be cleared, similar to arm.set\_state(4).



<mark style="color:blue;">2. How many movements can be recorded? Can record movements be played in different orders in Blockly?</mark>

We can customize the waterproof version, please send the application scenario to the support team.
