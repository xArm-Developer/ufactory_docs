# Q & A

1\. If the Emergency Button is pressed and then released, will the program continue to run next to the previous program?

A: NO, all caches on the control box will be cleared, similar to arm.set\_state(4).



2\. How many movements can be recorded? Can record movements be played in different orders in Blockly?

A: We don't limit the quantity of the record movements, it should be more than 1 million movements in total. You can record movements and play in different orders via the 'Import' block.



3\. Is the UFactory robot waterproof?

A: No, neither the UFactory robot nor the controller is waterproof.

We can customize the waterproof version, please send the application scenario to the support team.
